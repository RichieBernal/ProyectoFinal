    Custom scikit-learn transformer to perform one-hot encoding for categorical variables.

    Parameters:
        variables (list or str, optional): List of column names (variables) to perform one-hot encoding for.
            If a single string is provided, it will be treated as a single variable. Default is None.

    Attributes:
        variables (list): List of column names (variables) to perform one-hot encoding for.
        dummies (list): List of column names representing the one-hot encoded dummy variables.

        fit(X, y=None):
            Calculates the one-hot encoded dummy variable columns for the specified categorical variables from the training data.
            It returns the transformer instance itself.

        transform(X):
